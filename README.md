## Dependencies
This renderer depends on the following libraries and tools:

- Vulkan SDK: the Vulkan SDK provides the headers, libraries, and tools needed to develop Vulkan applications. You must have the Vulkan SDK installed on your system to build and run this renderer.

- GLFW: GLFW is a library that provides an easy-to-use API for creating windows, contexts, and handling user input. This renderer uses GLFW to create a Vulkan window and handle user input.

- GLM: GLM is a header-only C++ library for mathematics in graphics programming. This renderer uses GLM to perform matrix and vector operations.

- STB: STB is a collection of single-file libraries for C/C++ that provide useful image loading and manipulation functions. This renderer uses STB to load textures.
